    "ala": "",
    "alasa": "In some communities, the usage of \"alasa\" as a preverb meaning \"try to\" is equally or even more common than \"lukin\". In pu, only \"lukin\"/\"oko\" has this meaning.",
    "ale": "\"ali\" is an alternative to \"ale\", coined in a poll in 2002 in order to avoid confusion with \"ala\". However, the usage of \"ale\" over \"ali\" remains more common.\nThe majority of speakers report not understanding the \"abundant, bountiful, plentiful\" meaning, at least out of context.\n\"20, 120\" were non-pu meanings previously in use in the community alongside 100; they are virtually unheard of nowadays.",
    "ali": "\"ali\" is an alternative to \"ale\", coined in a poll in 2002 in order to avoid confusion with \"ala\". However, the usage of \"ale\" over \"ali\" has been more common since at least the release of pu. Generally not considered a word in its own right.",

    "anu": "The usage of \"anu\" as a content word meaning \"choose\" remains controversial.",
    "apeja": "According to jan Sonja, \"apeja\" never appeared in any pre-pu toki pona dictionary made by her and never promoted by her, instead it may have been \"just an experimental idea in a forum post\".",
    "awen": "",
    "e": "",
    "en": "There are various analyses of the syntactic role of \"en\". Originally intended to be used as \"and\", it was changed (via poll in 2002) to just be used with \"head nouns\". One of the more recent analyses (including 2021's April Fools) treats \"en\" as a subject marker.",

    "kiki": "The word is loaned from the 2001 Vilanyur S Ramachandran & Edward Hubbard version of Wolfgang Köhler's 1912 psycholinguistic experiment. The experiment studied sound symbolism on the words \"bouba\" and \"kiki\".",
    "kili": "In post-ku 2021, metaphorical definitions for kili have been suggested, including but not limited to \"offspring\" and \"product\", and are moderately popular. It is not yet clear whether this will remain in use long-term.",
    "kin": "In common usage (both before and after pu), \"a\" and \"kin\" are separate words, each with their own meaning. In pu, they are considered synonyms.\nUnderwent significant changes in usage in 2002, alongside \"en\" and (now obsolete) \"kan\".",

In pu, only \"lukin\" has this meaning.
