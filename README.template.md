# Anki deck using sona Linku
Anki decks based on [sona Linku](https://linku.la/about) for all languages.  

# Description
A new deck using [sitelen seli kiwen](https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/sitelenselikiwen/) for clean sitelen pona glyphs.  
The order of word introduction is based on [wasona](https://wasona.com/)'s order, so it's not alphabetical!  
Though word definitions are all from [Linku](https://linku.la/about).  
Includes word, definition, sitelen pona, commentary, usage % and category, coined by and era, found in book (pu, ku lili, etc), and links to nimi.li, sona pona and lipamanka's semantic space.
